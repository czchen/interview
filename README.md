Interview coding question collection.

# Algorithm Approach

## Examplify

Write out specific examples of the problem, and see if you can figure out a
general rule.

## Pattern Matching

Consider what problems the algorithm is similar to, and figure out if you can
modify the solution to develop an algorithm for this problem.

## Simplify & Generalize

Change a constraint (data type, size, etc) to simplify the problem. Then try to
solve it. Once you have an algorithm for the “simplified” problem, generalize
the problem again.

## Base Case And Build

Solve the algorithm first for a base case (e.g., just one element). Then, try
to solve it for elements one and two, assuming that you have the answer for
element one. Then, try to solve it for elements one, two and three, assuming
that you have the answer to ele- ments one and two.

## Data Structure Brainstorm

This is hacky, but it often works. Simply run through a list of data structures
and try to apply each one.
